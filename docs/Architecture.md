# Project Architecture

The **news-app** project follows a simple directory structure, where different components and routes are organized for clarity and maintainability. Here's an overview of the project's file structure based on the provided `App.jsx` file:

```
news-app/
  ├── public/
  │   ├── index.html
  │   └── ...
  ├── readme/
  │   └── ...
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── routes/
  │   │   ├── home/
  │   │   │   └── home.component.jsx
  │   │   ├── landing page/
  │   │   │   └── landing.component.jsx
  │   │   ├── news/
  │   │   │   └── news.component.jsx
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── App.jsx
  │   └── index.js
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── ...
```
